                    <h5 className="article-section">Aesthetic Theories​</h5>
                    <p>There are three common aesthetic theories concerning different aesthetic qualities in art criticism: </p>
                    <ul id="aesthetic-theories">
                        <li><b>Imitationalism</b>: Imitationalists think that the most important aesthetic qualities of an artwork is the literal qualities. The literal qualities are the realistic presentation of subject matter of an artwork. In their opinion, an artwork can be considered successful if it looks like and reminds the view of what they see in the reality. The Renaissance painter Leonardo da Vinci is a famous Imitationalist who claimed that the painting which is most like nature is the best.</li>
                        <li><b>Formalism</b>: In formalism​, an artwork is a significant form while formalists mainly concern with design qualities of an artwork. Significant form is a collection of visual elements and design principles that bring viewers aesthetic pleasure. The formalist Clive Bell stated that we need to bring nothing but a sense of form and colour to appreciate a work of art. The modern Post-Impressionist painter Cezanne is one of the well-known formalists who believed all forms can be simplified as geometric forms.</li>
                        <li><b>Emotionalism</b>: Emotionalists claim that no object can be considered art if it fails to arouse an emotional response in the viewer through the expressive qualities. The expressive qualities are qualities which convey ideas, moods, and feelings we can notice when we study the content of an artwork. The early medieval Chinese painter Gu Kaizhi can be viewed as an Emotionalist since he pointed out the importance of temperament over form.</li>

                            <p>French chemist Chevreul introduced the principles of harmony and contrast of colours which considered as the basis of colour scheme. He proposed that there are two types of harmony: similarity and contrast.</p>
                            <p>The harmony of similarity conveys the mood of peace while harmony of contrasts express dynamism.</p>
                            <ul id="type-of-harmony">
                                <li><b>Harmony of Similarity</b>: Combinations of similar hues, lightness, and saturation are harmonious.</li>
                                <li><b>Harmony of Contrasts</b>: Colours of the same or adjacent hues which are contrasting in lightness, or colours far apart on hue which have contrasting lightness and saturation are harmonious.</li>
